# Python-Business-Inteligence-Practise

The code shared here was developed during my participation in **Business Intelligence classes** held at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in 2023. Throughout the course, I undertook four exercises:

1. **Implementation of a Prime Numbers Generator** adhering to specified conditions described in python file.

2. **Initial exploration of Naive Forecasting techniques** involving my first attempts to experiment with Pandas and NumPy libraries.

Two noteworthy projects were undertaken during my academic journey:

3. **Pedestrian Dynamics:** This inaugural project involved the submission and preparation of an article. The primary objective was to calculate the real intersection angle between crossing pedestrians at various theoretical angles and define the deviation angle. The project also included the visualization of pedestrian velocity and deviation angle.

4. **Decisions:** The second project delved into the realm of Agent-Based simulations, exploring the application of knowledge in this domain. Agent-based simulation proves to be a valuable approach for studying the potential influence of individuals on a group of agents. This method is frequently employed to model real-life scenarios, offering insights into social influence dynamics and facilitating a comprehensive understanding of various phenomena. The project specifically focused on examining scenarios such as social interactions in settings like bars, decision-making processes within companies, or the impact of individuals on a larger population. In essence, the project involved simulating group decision-making processes, with a focus on the analysis of specific agents within the group.
